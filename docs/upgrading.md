# Upgrading

1. In the file `projectpy.toml` in the code repository of the Lime CRM solution, under the section `[tool.lime.dependencies]`, update the line specifying which version of the add-on `getaccept` that should be used. Use the latest one described in the [Changelog](changelog.md).
2. Build the Lime CRM solution as normally done, and install it as normally done.
